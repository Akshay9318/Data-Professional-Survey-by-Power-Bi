# Data-Professional-Survey-by-Power-Bi
I started by transforming the raw survey data in the Power Query Editor, where I cleaned and structured the data to ensure accuracy and relevance for analysis. After preparing the data, I created this comprehensive Data Professional Survey dashboard in Power BI.The dashboard visualizes key metrics from the survey, such as the distribution of respondents by country, favorite programming languages, and average salaries across different job titles like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst.Additionally, it provides insights into the challenges professionals face when breaking into the data field, with a breakdown of difficulty levels. The dashboard also features gauges displaying the average happiness scores of survey takers concerning work-life balance and salary satisfaction, giving a holistic view of the data professional landscape.
This dashboard is a powerful tool for understanding the trends and sentiments within the data community, helping organizations and individuals make informed decisions.
